          <p>I am a <type-writter></type-writter></p>
          <p>
            Currently located in Denver and born and raised in Napa Valley,
            California. Many of my projects involve digging into why tech is how
            it is, in my never-ending quest to understand as much of it as I
            can.

            In my free time, I enjoy making and listening to music, learning
            languages like Spanish and Japanese, swimming, as well as cooking
            and baking! I bring passion and dedication to every task, always
            striving for excellence.
