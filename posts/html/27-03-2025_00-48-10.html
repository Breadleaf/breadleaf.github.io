<p>My roommate <a class="open-new" href="https://ezrichards.github.io/">Ethan Richards</a> was a huge inspiration when creating my website!
A lot of my components were a blackbox recreation of how his website works (as of Thursday March 27 2025).
For his page he used <a class="open-new" href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> which I tried to get working but ultimately didn't enjoy much
of the workflow of. I also came into this project without knowing much about styling which again Ethan was a
<strong>huge</strong> help with. Ethan is a very talented frontend engineer, designing some really responsive layouts. He
helped me learn a lot about how to style my page, find more information on the
<a class="open-new" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">MDN</a> documentation online, as well as some other resources.</p>
