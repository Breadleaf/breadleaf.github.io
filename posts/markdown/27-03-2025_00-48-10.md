My roommate [Ethan Richards](https://ezrichards.github.io/) was a huge inspiration when creating my website!
A lot of my components were a blackbox recreation of how his website works (as of Thursday March 27 2025).
For his page he used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) which I tried to get working but ultimately didn't enjoy much
of the workflow of. I also came into this project without knowing much about styling which again Ethan was a
**huge** help with. Ethan is a very talented frontend engineer, designing some really responsive layouts. He
helped me learn a lot about how to style my page, find more information on the
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) documentation online, as well as some other resources.
